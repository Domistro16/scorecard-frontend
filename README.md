# Safucard

Safucard is a React-based decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to input their wallet address and receive a customized visual "SafuCard" scorecard. Users can optionally mint their SafuCard as an NFT to commemorate or showcase their on-chain profile.

## Features

* 🔌 Web3 wallet integration (via RainbowKit and wagmi)
* 📈 Fetches custom scorecard data from an external API
* 🎨 Renders a personalized canvas image using Fabric.js
* 🖼️ Downloads or fullscreen preview of generated SafuCard
* 🌐 Uploads assets to IPFS via backend proxy (Pinata)
* 🪙 Mints NFT with on-chain metadata and real-time price feeds
